# First3DGamebyme

My first 3D game built with MonoGame framework.

## About

This project is a 3D game developed using MonoGame and C#. It's designed to explore 3D game development concepts including rendering, camera systems, lighting, and physics.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- MonoGame 3.8.3
- Visual Studio 2022 (recommended) or VS Code

### Building and Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AK-NOT-47/First3DGamebyme.git
cd First3DGamebyme

# Build the project
cd First3DGamebyme
dotnet build

# Run the game
dotnet run
```

## Features (Planned)

- 3D camera system with free movement
- Basic 3D primitives rendering
- Lighting effects (ambient, directional, point lights)
- 3D model loading and rendering
- Simple physics and collision detection
- Particle effects
- Sound and music

## Controls (To be implemented)

- WASD - Move camera
- Mouse - Look around
- Space - Jump/Move up
- Shift - Run/Move down
- ESC - Exit game
